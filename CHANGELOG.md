## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-23

### ✨ New Features

- **5 New VAE Models**: Added support for `Wan2.2`, `LightVAE_W2.1`, `TAE_W2.2`, `LightTAE_HY1.5` (plus original `Wan2.1`).
- **Smart Resource Calculator**: Added "Pre-flight" check to analyze VRAM/RAM usage and recommend optimal settings before processing.
- **Auto-Download**: Added automatic downloading for missing VAE models from HuggingFace (`lightx2v/Autoencoders` repository).
- **Unified UI**: Replaced complex `vae_type` and `alt_vae` inputs with a single `vae_model` dropdown.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Black Borders**: Implemented correct "Padding → Process → Crop" logic to handle VAE dimension requirements without corrupting the output.
- **Fixed Video Glitches**: Corrected Tensor Permutation logic (`B,C,F,H,W` vs `B,H,W,C`) to prevent visual artifacts.
- **Fixed Model Loading**: Solved the issue where selecting "Wan2.2" incorrectly loaded "Wan2.1_VAE.pth".
- **Fixed OOM False Positive**: OOM recovery no longer triggers prematurely (adjusted threshold to 95%).

### ⚡ Optimization

- **Unified Pipeline**: Merged `tiny`, `full`, and `tiny-long` logic into a single optimized architecture.
- **OOM Protection**: Improved memory management with 95% VRAM threshold using `torch.cuda.mem_get_info()`.
- **Lossless Resize**: Uses `NEAREST` interpolation for integer scaling (0.5, 0.25) to avoid blur.
- **Aggressive Garbage Collection**: Added `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` before/after heavy VAE operations.

### 🛠 Refactoring

- **Explicit VAE Instantiation**: No more state_dict inspection/guessing - strict class mapping based on user selection.
- **VAE_MODEL_MAP**: Centralized configuration for all 5 VAE options (class, file, URL, dimensions).
- **Summary Logging**: End-of-processing report with total time, peak VRAM, and resolutions.
- **Debug Logging**: Shows `selected_model` vs `loaded_model_path` for verification.

### 📖 Documentation

- Updated README with VAE Selection Guide and VRAM tier recommendations.
- Added Best Practices section for Low/Medium/High VRAM configurations.
- Added Pre-Flight Resource Check documentation with example output.
- Added direct download links for all 5 VAE models.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-22

### 🚀 New Features

- **Wan2.2 VAE Support**: Integrated Wan2.2 VAE with optimized normalization statistics.
- **LightX2V VAE Integration**: Added LightX2V VAE for ~50% VRAM reduction and 2-3x faster inference.
- **VAE Type Selection**: Added `vae_model` dropdown in both Init Pipeline and Ultra-Fast nodes.
- **Factory Function**: Added `create_video_vae()` for programmatic VAE selection.

### ⚡ Performance

- **VRAM Reduction**: LightX2V reduces peak VRAM usage by approximately 50%.
- **Speed Improvement**: LightX2V provides 2-3x faster VAE decode times.

### 🛠 Refactoring

- **Backward Compatibility**: All new VAE types maintain full compatibility with existing Wan2.1 weights.
- **Architecture Constants**: Added `VAE_FULL_DIM`, `VAE_LIGHT_DIM`, `VAE_Z_DIM` for clarity.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-08

### ⚡ Performance

- **tiny-long Optimization**: Ported all VRAM optimizations and Tiled VAE support to `tiny-long` mode.
- **Windows Optimization**: Speed improvements for Windows environments.
- **Codebase Cleanup**: General synchronization and cleanup.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-07

### 🚀 New Features

- **Frame Chunking**: Added `frame_chunk_size` option to split large videos into chunks.
- **Attention Mode Selection**: Support for `flash_attention_2`, `sdpa`, `sparse_sage`, and `block_sparse`.
- **Debug Mode**: Added `enable_debug` option for extensive logging.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **OOM Auto-Recovery**: If OOM occurs, automatically retries with `tiled_vae=True`, then `tiled_dit=True`.
- **Non-Tiled Output**: Fixed bug where output was undefined in non-tiled processing path.
- **Progress Bar**: Fixed display in ComfyUI using `cqdm` wrapper.
- **Full Mode VAE**: Added fallback mechanism to manually load VAE if model manager fails.

### ⚡ Performance

- **Deferred VAE Loading**: In `full` mode, VAE loading is deferred until strictly necessary.
- **90% VRAM Warning**: Added proactive warning when VRAM usage approaches 90%.
- **Memory Cleanup**: Added `torch.cuda.ipc_collect()` for better cleanup.

### 🛠 Refactoring

- **Progress Bar**: Rewrote to use single-line in-place updates (`\r`).
- **Default Settings**: Updated defaults for 16GB cards (`unload_dit=True`, tiled options enabled).
- **Documentation**: Expanded tooltips for all node parameters.

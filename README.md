# ComfyUI-FlashVSR_Stable
Running FlashVSR on lower VRAM without any artifacts.

## Changelog

#### 07.12.2025
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed the progress bar to correctly display status in ComfyUI using the `cqdm` wrapper.
- **New Feature**: Added `frame_chunk_size` option to split large videos into chunks, enabling processing of large files on limited VRAM by offloading to CPU.
- **Enhancement**: Improved logging to show detailed resource usage (RAM, Peak VRAM, per-step timing) when `enable_debug` is active.
- **Optimization**: Added `torch.cuda.ipc_collect()` for better memory cleanup.
- **New Feature**: Added `attention_mode` selection with support for `flash_attention_2`, `sdpa`, `sparse_sage`, and `block_sparse` backends.
- **New Feature**: Implemented VAE spatial tiling to reduce VRAM usage during decoding (experimental).
- **Refactor**: Cleaned up code and improved error handling for imports.

#### 06.12.2025
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a shape mismatch error for small input frames by implementing correct padding logic.
- **Optimization**: VRAM is now immediately freed at the start of processing to prevent OOM errors.
- **New Feature**: Added `enable_debug` option for extensive logging (input shapes, tile stats, VRAM usage, processing time).
- **New Feature**: Added `keep_models_on_cpu` option to keep models in RAM (CPU) instead of VRAM, which is useful for GPUs with limited VRAM (e.g., 16GB).
- **Enhancement**: Added accurate FPS calculation and peak VRAM reporting (using `max_memory_reserved`) to the logs.
- **Optimization**: Replaced `einops` operations with native PyTorch ops for potential performance gains.
- **Optimization**: Added "Conv3d memory workaround" for improved compatibility with newer PyTorch versions.

#### 24.10.2025
- Added long video pipeline that significantly reduces VRAM usage when upscaling long videos.

#### 22.10.2025
- Replaced `Block-Sparse-Attention` with `Sparse_Sage`, removing the need to compile any custom kernels.  
- Added support for running on RTX 50 series GPUs.

#### 21.10.2025
- Initial release of this project, introducing features such as `tile_dit` to significantly reduce VRAM usage.

## Preview

## Usage
- **mode:**  
`tiny` -> faster (default); `full` -> higher quality  
- **scale:**  
`4` is always better, unless you are low on VRAM then use `2`    
- **color_fix:**  
Use wavelet transform to correct the color of output video.  
- **tiled_vae:**  
Set to True for lower VRAM consumption during decoding at the cost of speed.  
- **tiled_dit:**  
Significantly reduces VRAM usage at the cost of speed.
- **tile\_size, tile\_overlap**:  
How to split the input video.  
- **unload_dit:**  
Unload DiT before decoding to reduce VRAM peak at the cost of speed.  
- **frame_chunk_size**:
Split processing into chunks of N frames to save VRAM. 0 = Process all frames at once.
- **enable_debug:**  
Enable extensive logging for debugging purposes. Displays detailed information about device status, input dimensions, and per-tile processing statistics.
- **keep_models_on_cpu:**  
If enabled, models will be moved to RAM (CPU) after processing instead of remaining in VRAM. This helps prevent OOM errors on systems with limited VRAM.
- **attention_mode:**
Select the attention backend. Options include `sparse_sage`, `block_sparse`, `flash_attention_2` (requires `flash-attn`), and `sdpa` (PyTorch default).

# ComfyUI-FlashVSR_Stable
Running FlashVSR on lower VRAM without any artifacts.

## Changelog

#### 08.12.2025
- **Optimization**: Ported all VRAM optimizations and Tiled VAE support to `tiny-long` mode, ensuring feature parity across all modes.
- **Performance**: Optimized for Windows environments (speed improvements).
- **Update**: General codebase cleanup and synchronization.

#### 07.12.2025
- **VRAM Optimization**: Implemented auto-fallback for `process_chunk`. If OOM occurs, it automatically retries with `tiled_vae=True` and then `tiled_dit=True`, preventing crashes.
- **Critical Fix**: Fixed a bug in the non-tiled processing path where output was undefined.
- **Optimization**: Defer VAE loading in `full` mode until strictly necessary, significantly reducing peak VRAM usage.
- **Optimization**: Added a proactive 90% VRAM usage warning.
- **Refactor**: Rewrote progress bar to use single-line in-place updates (`\r`) for cleaner console output.
- **Defaults**: Updated default settings for `FlashVSR Ultra-Fast` node to be safer for 16GB cards (`unload_dit=True`, `tiled` options enabled).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed `AttributeError` in `full` mode by adding a fallback mechanism to manually load the VAE model if the model manager fails.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed the progress bar to correctly display status in ComfyUI using the `cqdm` wrapper. Added text-based progress bar to logs.
- **Sync**: Enabled VAE spatial tiling for `tiny` mode, bringing VRAM savings from `tiny-long` to the standard fast pipeline.
- **Documentation**: Expanded tooltips for all node parameters and added detailed usage instructions to README.
- **New Feature**: Added `frame_chunk_size` option to split large videos into chunks, enabling processing of large files on limited VRAM by offloading to CPU.
- **Enhancement**: Improved logging to show detailed resource usage (RAM, Peak VRAM, per-step timing) and model configuration details.
- **Optimization**: Added `torch.cuda.ipc_collect()` for better memory cleanup.
- **New Feature**: Added `attention_mode` selection with support for `flash_attention_2`, `sdpa`, `sparse_sage`, and `block_sparse` backends.
- **Refactor**: Cleaned up code and improved error handling for imports.

#### 06.12.2025
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a shape mismatch error for small input frames by implementing correct padding logic.
- **Optimization**: VRAM is now immediately freed at the start of processing to prevent OOM errors.
- **New Feature**: Added `enable_debug` option for extensive logging.
- **New Feature**: Added `keep_models_on_cpu` option to keep models in RAM (CPU) instead of VRAM.
- **Enhancement**: Added accurate FPS calculation and peak VRAM reporting.
- **Optimization**: Replaced `einops` operations with native PyTorch ops.
- **Optimization**: Added "Conv3d memory workaround".

#### 24.10.2025
- Added long video pipeline that significantly reduces VRAM usage when upscaling long videos.

#### 22.10.2025
- Replaced `Block-Sparse-Attention` with `Sparse_Sage`.
- Added support for running on RTX 50 series GPUs.

#### 21.10.2025
- Initial release of this project.

## Performance & VRAM Optimization

This node is optimized for various hardware configurations. Here are some guidelines:

### VRAM Tiers & Settings

| VRAM | Mode | Tiling | Chunk Size | Precision | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **24GB+** | `full` or `tiny` | Disabled | 0 (All) | `bf16`/`auto` | Max quality/speed. |
| **16GB** | `tiny` | `tiled_vae=True` | 0 or ~100 | `bf16`/`auto` | Enable `keep_models_on_cpu`. |
| **12GB** | `tiny` | `tiled_vae=True`, `tiled_dit=True` | ~50 | `fp16` | Use `sparse_sage` attention. |
| **8GB** | `tiny-long` | **Required** | ~20 | `fp16` | Must use tiling and chunking. |

### Performance Enhancements
- **Attention Mode**: Use `sparse_sage_attention` for the best balance of speed and memory. `flash_attention_2` is faster but requires specific hardware/installation.
- **Precision**: `bf16` (BFloat16) is recommended for RTX 3000/4000/5000 series. It is faster and preserves dynamic range better than `fp16`.
- **Chunking**: Use `frame_chunk_size` to process videos in segments. This moves processed frames to CPU RAM, preventing VRAM saturation on long clips.
- **Resize Input**: If the input video is large (e.g., 1080p), use the `resize_factor` parameter to reduce input size to `0.5x` before processing. This drastically reduces VRAM usage and allows for 4x upscaling of the resized result (net 2x output). For small videos, leave at `1.0`.

## Node Features

Hover over any input in ComfyUI to see these details:

- **model**: Select the FlashVSR model version.
- **mode**:
  - `tiny`: Standard fast mode. Now supports VAE tiling.
  - `tiny-long`: Streaming mode for very long videos. Lowest VRAM spike.
  - `full`: Uses the full VAE encoder (optional). Highest VRAM. Supports VAE tiling.
- **scale**: Upscaling factor (2x or 4x).
- **color_fix**: Corrects color shifts using wavelet transfer. Highly recommended.
- **tiled_vae**: Spatially splits frames during decoding. Saves massive VRAM at the cost of speed.
- **tiled_dit**: Spatially splits frames during diffusion. Crucial for large resolutions (e.g. 4k output).
- **tile_size / overlap**: Controls tile granularity. Smaller tiles = less VRAM but slower.
- **unload_dit**: Aggressively unloads the DiT model before VAE decode.
- **frame_chunk_size**: Splits the temporal dimension. Process N frames at a time.
- **enable_debug**: Prints detailed per-step logs, VRAM stats, and timing to the console.
- **keep_models_on_cpu**: Offloads models to system RAM when idle.
- **attention_mode**: Selects the underlying attention kernel.
